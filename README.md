This project implements a web application for predicting survival time of breast cancer patient based on input features using a machine learning model.

Features

- Input form for age and number of auxiliary nodes
- Predicts whether a patient's survival time is predicted to be beyond five years or not
- Built using Flask and scikit-learn

Usage

1. Enter the patient's age and number of auxiliary nodes in the provided input fields.
2. Click the "Predict" button to get a prediction for the patient's survival time.
3. The result will be displayed on the page.

Model Details

The SVM machine learning model used in this project is trained to predict the likelihood of a patient's survival time based on the input features.

Acknowledgments

- The dataset used for training the model is sourced from habermans-servival-data-set from kaggle.
- Built with Flask and scikit-learn.
